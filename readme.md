# Project 2: Neighborhood Guide App (aka Places! 1.0)

_Places!_ is an Android app for searching for a, erm, nearby place. It is backed by a local SQLite database and has search enabled. The user can search for a place by name, street, or type of place (i.e. "cafe") either by typing or by voice input. Once the user has found a place they're interested in, they can tap on the custom list item to see details about that place: a full image of it, the address, and a description. There are some features that have been included in the details view of each place:

 - The user can tap on the heart button to add the place to their favorites list, or to remove it from that list.
 - They can rate the place as 1 to 5 stars.
 - They can tap on the address to open the address in the Google Maps app.

From the home screen, there is a heart icon on the toolbar that will take the user to their saved list of favorite places. If the user wants to leave the favorites list or their active search and get back to the full list of places, they can tap the overflow menu in the toolbar and tap on "Home".

Nine manual test cases are included in a separate file, though I did not see anything I could run a unit test on.

**Known bugs**
 - When running the app in an emulator, it can occasionally crash with an out-of-memory error. This has not been a problem when running on a device.

Enjoy!
